Our Chrome extension is made to ensure that you get the breaks you need. After a user-set time period, such as every two hours, the extension automatically pops up on your computer, restricting access to all other applications until you complete the series of exercises given. The "x" button is removed to encourage actually engaging in the exercise routine. During this time, a built-in timer comes up and only counts down when it detects that you're actually stretching and performing the exercises, which works due to the integrated body tracking technology. This way, you get the physical benefits of taking a break, which mitigates the risks with long periods of sitting. It also serves as a gentle reminder to get up and take a walk or simply take a break from work, which is essential for productivity. In fact, according to DeskTime, productivity tends to decline after 52 minutes of continuous work, highlighting just how needed these regular breaks are.
